In addition, SO2 emissions oxidize in the atmosphere to form sulfates, which are one of the largest contributors to the formation of regional haze, which impairs visibility in the atmosphere by the scattering and absorption of sunlight by fine particles. Visibility impairment reduces the clarity, color, and visible distance that one can see. The District asserts its regulations limiting sulfur content in fuel oil used by certain fuel combustion sources and the prohibition of combustion of high sulfur content fuel oil within the District will decrease SO2 emissions and therefore strengthen the District's SIP. The reduction in SO2 emissions helps the District to maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for SO2 and PM2.5. Additional SO2 emission reductions and subsequent reductions in sulfates from District sources combusting lower sulfur fuel will assist the District in achieving further reasonable progress towards reducing regional haze. Under section 169A of the CAA, it is a national goal to remedy and prevent regional haze in any Class I areas.\\1\\ Section 169A requires states which contain Class I areas and states from which emissions may reasonably be anticipated to cause or contribute to visibility impairment in Class I areas to submit SIP revisions to make reasonable progress toward meeting the national goal (regional haze SIPs). The District's regional haze program to address visibility impairment requirements in Class I areas was fully approved into the District's SIP by EPA on February 2, 2012. See 77 FR 5191.\\2\\ The District has submitted revised regulations for SIP approval to implement its low sulfur fuel oil program.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1750179300,"_task_hash":1154812597,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

This rulemaking is commonly referred to as the ``March, 2010 RFS2 final rule''. As part of the March, 2010 RFS2 final rule we analyzed various categories of biofuels to determine whether the complete lifecycle GHG emissions (domestic and international) associated with the production, distribution, and use of those fuels meet minimum lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction thresholds as specified in CAA section 211(o) (i.e., 60% for cellulosic biofuel, 50% for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel, and 20% for other renewable fuels). Our final rule focused our lifecycle analyses on fuels that were anticipated to contribute relatively large volumes of renewable fuel by 2022 and thus did not cover all fuels that either are contributing or could potentially contribute to the program. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA indicated that it had not completed the GHG emissions impact analysis for several specific biofuel production pathways but that this work would be completed through supplemental rulemaking processes. Since the final rule was issued, we have continued to examine several additional pathways. On June 12, 2012, we published a Notice of Data Availability Concerning Renewable Fuels Produced From Grain Sorghum Under the RFS Program (see 77 FR 34915). In that notice of data availability, we provided an opportunity for comment on EPA's analysis of grain sorghum used as a feedstock to produce ethanol under the RFS program. Today's final rule describes our lifecycle analysis of ethanol made from grain sorghum (``grain sorghum ethanol'') and presents our determination that grain sorghum ethanol qualifies as renewable fuel (20% lifecycle GHG reduction as compared to baseline fuel) or as advanced biofuel (50% lifecycle GHG reduction as compared to baseline fuel) if produced pursuant to specified pathways. The modeling approach EPA used in this analysis is the same general approach used in the March, 2010 RFS2 final rule for lifecycle analyses of other biofuels.\\1\\ The March, 2010 RFS2 final rule preamble and Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides further discussion of our approach.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-325935927,"_task_hash":-904617679,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Where nonattainment areas include both Indian country and state land, it is important for states and tribes to work together to coordinate planning efforts.

Therefore a revision will not be required to the related EPAAR clause, 1552.211-74 Work Assignments; as this change does not affect the meaning of the clause. The revised language communicates to contract personnel and program staff that government cost-related estimates should not be provided to contractors prior to receiving the contractor's work plan (proposal); and how to address exceptions.

This includes all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information. This chemical will be applied as a fungicide to agricultural food crops and as a post-harvest treatment to stored potatoes at 35,600 ppm or less. There is very little potential for dietary exposure to phosphorous acid, exposure in drinking water, and from non-dietary, non- occupational exposures. Once released into the environment, the chemical rapidly dissociates to form hydrogen and phosphite ions, important nutrients for plants and animals. While the formation of these degradates may be compromised when phosphorous acid is applied as a post-harvest treatment, the recommended application rate will significantly reduce any new dietary exposure or risks and is considered to be safe.\n","EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-1018-0004":"FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) provides that, in considering the establishment of a tolerance or tolerance exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, EPA shall assess the available information about consumption patterns among infants and children, special susceptibility of infants and children to pesticide chemical residues, and the cumulative effects on infants and children of the residues and other substances with a common mechanism of toxicity. In addition, FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure, unless EPA determines that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act Safety Factor. In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional or no safety factor when reliable data are available to support a different additional or no safety factor. As part of its qualitative assessment, EPA evaluated the available toxicity and exposure data on pear ester and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability, as well as the relationship of this information to human risk. EPA considers the toxicity database to be complete and has identified no residual uncertainty with regard to prenatal and postnatal toxicity or exposure. No hazard was identified based on the available studies.

Many of these rules were added to SIPs and approved by the EPA in the years shortly after the 1970 amendments to the CAA, which for the first time provided for the system of clean air plans that were to be prepared by air agencies and approved by the EPA. At that time, it was widely believed that emission limitations set at levels representing good control of emissions during periods of so-called ``normal'' operation (which, until no later than 1982, was meant by the EPA to refer to periods of operation other than during startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction) could in some cases not be met with the same emission control strategies during periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction.\\2\\ Accordingly, it was common for state plans to include provisions for special, more lenient treatment of excess emissions during such periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction. Many of these provisions took the form of absolute or conditional statements that excess emissions from a source, when they occur during startup, shutdown, malfunction or otherwise outside of the source's so- called ``normal'' operations, were not to be considered violations of the air agency rules; i.e., these emissions were considered exempt from legal control.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-127106776,"_task_hash":-454246225,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. This rule will require all sources to meet the applicable monitoring requirements of 40 CFR part 75. Part 75 already incorporates a number of voluntary consensus standards. Consistent with the Agency's Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS), Part 75 sets forth performance criteria that allow the use of alternative methods to the ones set forth in Part 75. The PBMS approach is intended to be more flexible and cost effective for the regulated community; it is also intended to encourage innovation in analytical technology and improved data quality. At this time, EPA is not recommending any revisions to Part 75; however, EPA periodically revises the test procedures set forth in Part 75. When EPA revises the test procedures set forth in Part 75 in the future, EPA will address the use of any new voluntary consensus standards that are equivalent. Currently, even if a test procedure is not set forth in Part 75, EPA is not precluding the use of any method, whether it constitutes a voluntary consensus standard or not, as long as it meets the performance criteria specified; however, any alternative methods must be approved through the petition process under 40 CFR 75.66 before they are used.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0491-0026":"Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS) in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.

These amendments further improve the rule to both reduce burden on air agencies as well as make minor technical corrections that reflect what has been put into practice through existing electronic reporting implementation.\n","EPA-R09-OAR-2013-0534-0001":"On November 9, 2011 (76 FR 69896), we published a partial approval and partial disapproval of the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District's (SJVUAPCD or District) 2008 PM2.5 Plan and the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2007 State Strategy (collectively the ``SJV PM2.5 SIP''). As part of this action, EPA disapproved the contingency measure provisions in the SJV PM2.5 SIP as failing to meet the requirements of Clean Air Act (CAA) section 172(c)(9) and 40 CFR 51.1012, which require that the SIP for each PM2.5 nonattainment area contain contingency measures to be implemented if the area fails to make reasonable further progress or to attain the NAAQS by the applicable attainment date. See 76 FR 41338, 41357 to 41559 (July 13, 2011) and 76 FR 69896, 69924 (November 9, 2011). This disapproval action became effective on January 9, 2012 and started a sanctions clock for imposition of offset sanctions 18 months after January 9, 2012 and highway sanctions 6 months later, pursuant to CAA section 179 and our regulations at 40 CFR 52.31. As such, offset sanctions applied on July 9, 2013 and will continue to apply, and highway sanctions will apply on January 9, 2014, unless EPA determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the disapproval has been corrected.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-625974312,"_task_hash":-362423263,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

The States comment that they have done their share to reduce in-state emissions, and EPA should ensure each state fully addresses its contribution to any other state's ozone nonattainment. The commenters state that section 110(a)(1) of the CAA requires states like West Virginia to submit, within three years of promulgation of a new NAAQS, an infrastructure SIP which provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of such NAAQS within the state. The commenters remark that West Virginia was required to submit a complete SIP that demonstrated compliance with the good neighbor provision of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the CAA. Maryland also states that EPA must disapprove the infrastructure submittal for element 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) as West Virginia made no submittal for that element. Maryland also argues that if EPA believes EME Homer City prohibits it from disapproving the 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) portion of the West Virginia SIP before the state's significant contribution level is established, then EPA should immediately promulgate such a level. Sierra Club, in turn, states that EPA must disapprove West Virginia's SIP submission for failure to comply with 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). Sierra Club and Maryland both argue that EPA cannot rely on the D.C. Circuit decision in EME Homer City Generation v. EPA, 696 F.3d 7 (D.C. Cir. 2012) as an excuse to ignore obligations established by the Clean Air Act.

With the updates included in the 2013 version of the ASTM E1527 standard, ASTM modified the definition of migration to specifically include vapor migration and remove any confusion regarding the need to identify all RECs, or all indications of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, when conducting an AAI investigation.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-323706303,"_task_hash":844648234,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

EPA relied upon that comparison to determine that all of the sources in New Mexico are achieving the emission levels assumed by WRAP in its modeling except for the SJGS. SJCC alleged that EPA's summary of that analysis presents no relevant data to support the Agency's conclusion. Because the WRAP inventories are so extensive and difficult to research and review, EPA at a minimum should have provided copies of the State's emissions inventories that were reviewed and the specific emissions data for SJGS that supports EPA's conclusion. SJCC stated that EPA should not have put the burden of interpreting the WRAP technical support documents on the reader. Furthermore, in light of the substantial number and different types of emission sources throughout New Mexico, our conclusion is suspect.

According to the commenter's analysis, Group 1 storage vessels that do not experience an event that would increase emissions would result in an increase from the final NSPS in VOC emissions of over 3 million tpy and methane emissions of over 700,000 tpy. In addition, the commenter states that the six-month delay of the compliance date for Group 2 storage vessels results in an increases of 450,000 tpy of VOC emissions and 100,000 tpy of methane emissions. The commenter added that the removal of a control device from sources whose uncontrolled emissions drop below 4 tpy would result in an emission increase of 3.8 tpy VOC per vessel. Assuming that the 11,600 new vessels the EPA projects would qualify for the uncontrolled actual VOC emission rate, emissions would increase by 23,000 tpy VOC and 5,000 tpy methane. The commenter also contends that the removal of the control device would result in sources left uncontrolled during any unplanned events that would generate significant emissions. Additionally, the commenter states that using their decline curve analysis, new sources would not qualify for uncontrolled actual VOC emission rate for at least 14 years, and the increase in pollution is not justified by the EPA's control device availability concerns.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":2146046742,"_task_hash":1986598215,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Commenters contended that such a methodology produced limits that are not achievable in combination, and as such, the limits do not comport with the intent of the statute or the recent court decision (NRDC v. EPA, 2007). Commenters argue that while the Court's 2007 decision in NRDC v. EPA vacating the first ICI boiler and process heater MACT standard directed EPA to consider individual HAPs, it did not direct EPA to establish a separate floor for each HAP. Commenters further added that the Clean Air Act (CAA) directs EPA to set standards based on the overall performance of ``sources'' and sections 112(d)(1), (2), and (3) specify that emissions standards be established on the ``in practice'' performance of a ``source'' in the category or subcategory. If Congress had intended for EPA to establish MACT floor levels considering the achievable emission limits of individual HAPs, it could have worded 112(d)(3) to refer to the best-performing sources ``for each pollutant.'' Many commenters added that EPA's discretion in setting standards is limited to distinguishing among classes, types, and sizes of sources. However, Congress limited EPA's authority to parse units and sources with similar design and types but it does not allow EPA to ``distinguish'' units and sources by individual pollutant as proposed in this rule [Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 2008)]. By calculating each MACT floor independently of the other pollutants, the combination of HAP limits results in a set of standards that only a hypothetical ``best performing'' unit could achieve.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1315341539,"_task_hash":-980325456,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Until today, EPA has not required any monitoring requirements beyond visual inspections for discharges associated with construction activity, although some NPDES-authorized states (e.g., California, Georgia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) have imposed monitoring requirements on construction operators in their permits. See relevant state permit requirements in the rulemaking record (DCNs 42104, 42108-42111). Now that EPA is adopting a numeric effluent limitation for turbidity for certain construction sites, permits authorizing discharges associated with construction activity from those sites are required to include monitoring requirements in NPDES permits for discharges associated with construction activity.

{"text":"May Title V Permits Be Issued to Exempt Area Sources?","meta":{"# of occurrences: ":"1\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0010-0114":"In the proposal, we explained and sought comment on our proposed interpretation of the Act as allowing only those area sources required to be permitted under section 502(a), and not exempted by EPA through notice and comment rulemaking to be subject to title V requirements. We are finalizing that interpretation in today's final rule. Thus, after the effective date of today's final rule, permitting authorities, including State and local agencies, tribes, and EPA, may not issue title V permits, including general permits, to area sources we exempt in today's final rule. This interpretation of the Act means that permitting authorities must stop issuing new title V permits to area sources we exempt today, unless they are subject to title V for another reason. Also, this means that any existing title V permits for such exempted area sources must be revoked or terminated after the effective date of today's final rule. However, to avoid disruptions to State programs, States may wait until renewal to end the effectiveness of such permits, unless an area source requests that this be done expeditiously. The EPA believes that State issuance of title V permits to area sources that EPA has exempted from title V permitting requirements would conflict with Congress's intent that EPA define the universe of sources subject to title V, and through inappropriate focus on sources that qualify for an exemption, would be an obstacle to implementation of the title V program. Even if the statute were ambiguous in this regard, EPA would exercise its discretion to interpret it this way to promote effective title V implementation. The proposal included a discussion of these issues, and in the final rule, EPA's interpretation of the Act in this regard is unchanged from the proposal. See section VI below for more on EPA's interpretation of these Act provisions. Note, however, that EPA interprets Section 116 of the Act to allow permitting authorities to issue non-title V permits to area sources that we have exempted from title V permitting.

With the premise that boilers do have variable CO emissions, in order to meet the applicable emission limit, commenters stated that stable boiler operation would be necessary, but that such boiler operation is not always possible. They contend that boiler loads vary constantly and rapidly and such load swings are a normal part of many processes and operations. Factors affecting the load include changes in fuel mix, fuel quantity, and fluctuations in load demand. Quick changes or large swings can also result in spikes which are substantially higher than average emissions.

In the Arkansas RH proposal, EPA did not justify its decision that the presumptive BART limits are unacceptable. EPA is insisting on a five factor analysis even when a source can meet the presumptive limits. EPA's current interpretation of the presumptive BART limits makes the presumptive BART limits meaningless, contrary to the requirements of the CAA and the clear intent of the BART Rule. The CAA singles out electric generating units (EGUs) located at 750 megawatt (MW) power plants for specific BART controls (42 U.S.C. 7491(b)(2)), and EPA adopted the presumptive BART limits to establish the specific control levels required for these EGUs. Since EPA went through extensive analysis to establish presumptive BART limits, the only rational explanation is that EPA intended for those limits to be meaningful. EPA is rationalizing its decision on the Arkansas RH SIP as if the presumptive BART limits were no longer a binding regulation, and there is concern that EPA is attempting to establish new, more stringent presumptive BART limits through case-by-case disapprovals of state BART determinations. Unless and until EPA goes through notice and comment rulemaking to remove the presumptive emission limits and establish other requirements consistent with the CAA, the presumptive BART limits in the promulgated BART Rule continue to establish the requirement that states must meet in their regional haze SIPs for large coal-fired EGUs and EPA must approve a state's BART determination if it meets the presumptive regulatory limits.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1612438990,"_task_hash":-1278502532,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

The EPA has proposed a total PM limit for existing EGUs of 0.03 lb/MMBtu, as a surrogate limit for non-mercury metal hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) (see 76 FR 24975). EPA should not approve the lax PM limit of 0.1 lb/MMBtu for Flint Creek Boiler No. 1 and Entergy White Bluff Units 1 and 2 as meeting BART for PM because that emission limit is much less stringent than the forthcoming PM MACT requirement. Recent stack testing for White Bluff Units 1 and 2 show that the units will not be able to meet EPA's proposed mercury MACT limit for existing units of 1.2 lb/MMBtu. It is likely that both Flint Creek Boiler No. 1 and White Bluff Units 1 and 2 will need to install baghouses to meet EPA's mercury MACT limit for existing EGUs. It is well known that coal- fired boilers equipped with baghouses achieve better control of mercury than those equipped with ESPs. Activated carbon, a sorbent which adsorbs mercury, is typically much more effective when a baghouse is used compared to an ESP. According to EPA, the form of mercury most easily removed is HgCl2 and the formation of this compound depends on how much chlorine is in the coal--the lower the chlorine content of the coal, the less HgCl2 is formed. EGUs that burn low chlorine coal, such as Flint Creek, often achieve better control of mercury via existing SO2 scrubbers and PM controls.

In particular, the EPA noted four substantive issues that may exist in the previously existing SIPs that the Agency wanted to be clear were not among the issues that states and the EPA are addressing in actions on infrastructure SIPs: (i) Start-up, shut-down, malfunction (SSM) provisions; (ii) director's discretion provisions; (iii) minor source NSR provisions; and (iv) NSR Reform related provisions.\\4\\\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1580002331,"_task_hash":-46943233,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Referencing the TCEQ's Air Quality Modeling Guidelines and ``Draft Ozone Procedures'' document,\\37\\ the commenters maintain that TCEQ routinely issues PSD permits based on outdated and inadequate ozone modeling procedures. One commenter adds that the ozone screening procedure authorized by the TCEQ's modeling guidance document is partly based on, or equivalent to, inappropriate ``Scheffe Tables.'' Additionally, the commenter states the ozone screening method involves ratios of NOX to VOC without considering the impact of biogenic emissions. Two commenters state that the EPA has on multiple occasions informed the TCEQ that the ozone screening procedures authorized by the TCEQ are outdated and unreliable to evaluate a single source's ozone modeling impact on an air quality control region. One commenter states that the Texas SIP is insufficient to comport with section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act unless it is revised to expressly require case-by-case ozone impact analyses to be conducted for major sources of ozone precursors based on sufficient modeling techniques.

This included reference to various EPA estimates and was supplemented by several estimates for specific areas. Several commenters pointed out the acute need for reduced emissions from these engines in California, particularly in the South Coast Air Basin. For example, over half of current or projected levels of SOx and diesel PM emissions in the South Coast Air Basin are estimated to come from marine vessels (or all port-related sources). SOx emissions from marine vessels in particular would need to be reduced by about 90 percent in the next few years for the South Coast Air Basin to reach timely attainment of the air quality standard for PM2.5. The South Coast Basin is also home to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which are claimed to be the entry point for 40 percent of the nation's goods, with cargo throughput projected to triple by 2025. Santa Barbara County, California was noted as another particular concern, where 75 percent of local NOX emissions are projected to come from marine vessels, even though there are no commercial ports within county boundaries. One commenter referenced a finding that 70 percent of global shipping emissions occur within 400 kilometers of shore, where pollution transport may range from 400 to 1200 kilometers inland.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-477284591,"_task_hash":-735067280,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Arkansas submitted its RH SIP earlier than most other states, including at least 18 months before North Dakota and Oklahoma, yet EPA did not propose a FIP concurrently with its proposed partial disapproval of the Arkansas RH SIP and it appears it will be several years before the facilities in the State that are contributing to regional haze install pollution controls and reduce emissions. The residents and visitors to the State of Arkansas are getting the short shrift from EPA compared to the residents and visitors of these other states.
