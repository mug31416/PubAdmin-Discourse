Nitrogen/phosphorus pollution problems have been recognized for some time in the U.S., for example a 1969 report by the National Academy of Sciences \\14\\ notes ``[t]he pollution problem is critical because of increased population, industrial growth, intensification of agricultural production, river-basin development, recreational use of waters, and domestic and industrial exploitation of shore properties. Accelerated eutrophication causes changes in plant and animal life-- changes that often interfere with use of water, detract from natural beauty, and reduce property values.'' Inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus lead to over-enrichment in many of the Nation's waters and constitute a widespread, persistent, and growing problem. Nitrogen/phosphorus pollution in fresh water systems can significantly impact aquatic life and long-term ecosystem health, diversity, and balance. More specifically, high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings result in harmful algal blooms (HABs), reduced spawning grounds and nursery habitats, fish kills, and oxygen-starved hypoxic or ``dead'' zones. Public health concerns related to nitrogen/phosphorus pollution include impaired surface and groundwater drinking water sources from high levels of nitrates, possible formation of disinfection byproducts in drinking water, and increased exposure to toxic microbes such as cyanobacteria.15 16 Degradation of water bodies from nitrogen/phosphorus pollution can result in economic consequences. For example, given that fresh and salt water fishing in Florida are significant recreational and tourist attractions generating over six billion dollars annually,\\17\\ changes in Florida's waters that degrade water quality to the point that sport fishing populations are affected, will also affect this important part of Florida's economy.

In each instance where EPA is listing a newly submitted substitute as unacceptable or is changing the status of a substitute from acceptable to unacceptable, EPA has determined that there are other alternatives that pose lower overall risk to human health and the environment. In a few instances, EPA established narrowed use limits for certain substitutes for specific military or space-and aeronautics-related applications in the refrigeration and AC, and foam blowing sectors, on the basis that other acceptable alternatives would not be available for those specific applications within broader end-uses, but acceptable alternatives were expected to become available over time. This action also applies unacceptability determinations for foam blowing agents to closed cell foam products and products containing closed cell foam. Additionally, EPA is exempting propane as a refrigerant in new self-contained commercial ice machines, in new water coolers, and in new very low temperature refrigeration equipment from the venting prohibition under CAA section 608(c)(2). This action also clarifies the listing for Powdered Aerosol D (Stat- X[supreg]), which was previously listed as both acceptable and acceptable, subject to use conditions, by removing the listing as acceptable subject to use conditions. The emissions that will be avoided from the changes of status in this action are estimated to be up to approximately 6.6 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MMTCO2eq) in 2025 and up to approximately 11.3 MMTCO2eq in 2030.\\25\\\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1807284516,"_task_hash":-1530007041,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Controls installed to reduce HAP would also reduce ambient concentrations of PM2.5 as a co-benefit. Reducing exposure to PM2.5 is associated with significant human health benefits, including avoiding mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Researchers have associated PM2.5 exposure with adverse health effects in numerous toxicological, clinical and epidemiological studies (U.S. EPA, 2009).\\19\\ When adequate data and resources are available and a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) is required, the EPA generally quantifies several health effects associated with exposure to PM2.5 (e.g., U.S. EPA, 2011).\\20\\ These health effects include premature mortality for adults and infants, cardiovascular morbidities such as heart attacks, hospital admissions and respiratory morbidities such as asthma attacks, acute and chronic bronchitis, hospital and emergency department visits, work loss days, restricted activity days and respiratory symptoms. Although the EPA has not quantified certain outcomes including adverse effects on birth weight, pre-term births, pulmonary function and other cardiovascular and respiratory effects, the scientific literature suggests that exposure to PM2.5 is also associated with these impacts (U.S. EPA, 2009). PM2.5 also increases light extinction, which is an important aspect of visibility (U.S. EPA, 2009).\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1927119579,"_task_hash":-968429988,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

EPA in fact intended that the same compliance date apply for all changes to rule requirements for existing sources. This is evident since EPA indicated generally that it was establishing a compliance date of three years for the September 9, 2010, requirements for existing sources (75 FR at 54993), and never discussed or otherwise suggested (in either the proposed or final rule) any alternative compliance date.

EPA requested comment on the practicality of implementing the following specific changes within 60 days of final rule promulgation: Minimum Number of Samples Required (III.A), Definitions for Compliance and Monitoring Periods (III.B), Consumer Notification of Lead Tap Water Monitoring Results (III.E) and Public Education Requirements (III.F). EPA also requested comment upon whether all of the proposed revisions should have an effective date earlier than three years after publication of the final rule. After reviewing comments, EPA is adopting a compliance date for all of the final rule provisions, of 180 days after publication in the Federal Register or the effective date of any State program changes needed to implement the rule, whichever is later.

Specifically, CAA section 111(b)(1)(A) requires that a source category be included on the list if, ``in [the EPA Administrator's] judgment it causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.'' This determination is commonly referred to as an ``endangerment finding'' and that phrase encompasses both of the ``causes or contributes significantly to'' component and the ``endanger public health or welfare'' component of the determination. Once a source category is listed, CAA section 111(b)(1)(B) requires that the EPA propose and then promulgate ``standards of performance'' for new sources in such source category. Other than the endangerment finding for listing the source category, CAA section 111(b) gives no direction or enumerated criteria concerning what constitutes a source category or what emission sources or pollutants from a given source category should be the subject of standards. Therefore, as long as the EPA makes the requisite endangerment finding for the source category to be listed, CAA section 111 leaves the EPA with the authority and discretion to define the source category, determine the pollutants for which standards should be developed, and identify the emission sources within the source category for which standards of performance should be established.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1585392673,"_task_hash":-1337130831,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

EPA has identified HMIWI as a source category that emits five of the seven CAA Section 112(c)(6) pollutants: POM, dioxins, furans, Hg, and PCBs. (The POM emitted by HMIWI is composed of 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and extractable organic matter (EOM).) In the Federal Register notice Source Category Listing for Section 112(d)(2) Rulemaking Pursuant to Section 112(c)(6) Requirements, 63 FR 17838, 17849, Table 2 (1998), EPA identified medical waste incinerators (now referred to as HMIWI) as a source category ``subject to regulation'' for purposes of CAA Section 112(c)(6) with respect to the CAA Section 112(c)(6) pollutants that HMIWI emit. HMIWI are solid waste incineration units currently regulated under CAA Section 129. For purposes of CAA Section 112(c)(6), EPA has determined that standards promulgated under CAA Section 129 are substantively equivalent to those promulgated under CAA Section 112(d). (See id. at 17845; see also 62 FR 33625, 33632 (1997).) As discussed in more detail below, the CAA Section 129 standards effectively control emissions of the five identified CAA Section 112(c)(6) pollutants. Further, since CAA Section 129(h)(2) precludes EPA from regulating these substantial sources of the five identified CAA Section 112(c)(6) pollutants under CAA Section 112(d), EPA cannot further regulate these emissions under that CAA section. As a result, EPA considers emissions of these five pollutants from HMIWI ``subject to standards'' for purposes of CAA Section 112(c)(6).\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1392048451,"_task_hash":-180626313,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Given this, and after carefully considering comments received on the proposed rule, EPA finds it appropriate to postpone the earliest compliance dates for the new, more stringent, BAT effluent limitations and PSES applicable to FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water in the 2015 Rule until it completes the new rulemaking. This maintains the 2015 Rule as a whole at this time, with the only change being to postpone specific compliance deadlines for two wastestreams. Thus, the earliest compliance dates for plants to meet the new, more stringent FGD wastewater and bottom ash wastewater limitations and standards in the 2015 Rule, which were to be determined by the permitting authority as a date ``as soon as possible beginning November 1, 2018 . . .'', are now to be determined by the permitting authority as a date ``as soon as possible beginning November 1, 2020 . . . .''

In order to increase public health protection, she is revising the level of the primary standard to 70 ppb, in conjunction with retaining the current indicator, averaging time and form. The Administrator concludes that such a revised standard will be requisite to protect public health with an adequate margin of safety. As discussed more fully below, the rationale for these final decisions draws from the thorough review in the ISA (U.S. EPA, 2013) of the available scientific evidence, generally published through July 2011, on human health effects associated with the presence of O3 in the ambient air. This rationale also takes into account: (1) Analyses of O3 air quality, human exposures to O3, and O3-associated health risks, as presented and assessed in the HREA (U.S. EPA, 2014a); (2) the EPA staff assessment of the most policy-relevant scientific evidence and exposure/risk information in the PA (U.S. EPA, 2014c); (3) CASAC advice and recommendations, as reflected in discussions of drafts of the ISA, REA, and PA at public meetings, in separate written comments, and in CASAC's letters to the Administrator; (4) public input received during the development of these documents, either in connection with CASAC meetings or separately; and (5) public comments on the proposal notice.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1884615427,"_task_hash":-1675627819,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

In addition, early action to improve air quality can help an eventual nonattainment area, particularly an area that has never been designated nonattainment before, to establish working relationships between key stakeholders. The EPA's expectation is that early actions to reduce emissions in such areas would be less resource-intensive than actions taken once a nonattainment designation has been made, since at that point the implementation of controls would need to occur in conjunction with actions to comply with other requirements such as nonattainment NSR and transportation conformity.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1056070473,"_task_hash":-233513641,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

These effects can vary depending on the form of mercury to which a person or animal is exposed, as well as the magnitude, duration, and frequency of exposure. The most prevalent human and wildlife exposure to mercury results from ingesting fish contaminated with methylmercury. Methylmercury is an organo-metallic compound that is formed via the conversion of elemental or inorganic mercury compounds by certain microorganisms and other natural processes. For example, elemental mercury may evaporate and be emitted into the atmosphere.

Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, formerly the sole manufacturer of the commercial pentaBDE and octaBDE products in the United States, voluntarily discontinued their manufacture for all uses by December 31, 2004. With Great Lakes Chemical Corporation's exit from the market, EPA believes that all production in and import into the United States of these chemicals has ceased. However, EPA is concerned that manufacture or import could be reinitiated in the future, and wants the opportunity to evaluate and control, if appropriate, exposures associated with those activities. Based on the situation prior to January 1, 2005, including substantial production volume, number of uses, potential for widespread release and exposure, as well as the PBT nature of the chemical substances, any new manufacture or import after that date is expected to significantly increase exposures now that manufacture and import have been discontinued, over that which could otherwise exist.

Equipment manufacturers will need to modify their equipment designs to accommodate these new engine technologies and the corresponding changes to engine operating parameters (such as operating temperatures and heat rejection rates). To provide flexibility for equipment manufacturers in their efforts to respond to these engine design changes, the Tier 4 standards included the Transition Program for Equipment Manufacturers. Flexibilities allowed under this program include delaying compliance for small-volume equipment models for several years or using allowances in the first year to manage the transition to the Tier 4 engines. While a certain number of allowances are available to all companies, the regulation provides additional relief for nonroad diesel equipment manufacturers under certain limited circumstances we refer to as ``technical hardship''.

Since then, based in part on public comments submitted by industry groups, the Agency has learned that plants refer to the same operation using different terminology; some classify non-chemical metal cleaning waste as such, while others classify it as low volume waste sources. Because the survey responses reflect each plant's individual nomenclature, the survey results for non-chemical metal cleaning wastes are skewed. Furthermore, EPA does not know the nomenclature each plant used in responding to the survey, so it has no way to adjust the results to account for this. Consequently, EPA does not have sufficient information on the extent to which discharges of non-chemical metal cleaning wastes occur, or on the ways that industry manages their non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. Moreover, EPA also does not have information on potential best available technologies or best available demonstrated control technologies, or the potential costs to industry to comply with any new requirements. Due to incomplete data, some public commenters urged EPA not to establish BAT limitations for non-chemical metal cleaning wastes in this final rule. Ultimately, EPA decided that it does not have enough information on a national basis to establish BAT/NSPS/PSES/PSNS requirements for non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. The final rule, therefore, continues to ``reserve'' BAT/NSPS/PSES/PSNS for non-chemical metal cleaning wastes, as the previously promulgated regulations did.\\40\\\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-497427063,"_task_hash":1790647198,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Thus, EPA is now narrowing its approval of most approved title V programs so that those title V programs are approved to apply to GHG-emitting sources only if those sources emit GHGs at or above the final Tailoring Rule thresholds.

In general, the first two criteria address whether the standard in question created the possibility that a technological laggards could develop, while the third criterion addresses the likelihood that there will be a technological laggard. For the 2010 NOX standard, we find that these criteria have been met for heavy heavy-duty diesel engines, and it is therefore appropriate to establish NCPs for this standard for the current model year and later.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1750749595,"_task_hash":1805102804,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

One commenter concurred with the concept of defining an end point for such processes. However, the commenter is concerned that the proposed definition could be misapplied on polymer production processes that have no dryer and no extruder or die-plate. The commenter explained that their solid-state polymerization process for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) operates without any of this equipment. The finished polymer is discharged from the reactors as a coarse, ready-to-use powder. Without clarification, the commenter is concerned that the proposed definition conceivably extends the PET process into the subsequent film manufacturing process, which would conflict with previous guidance EPA has provided regarding the applicability of 40 CFR part 63, subpart FFFF. To clarify this situation, the commenter suggested the endpoint for solid-state polymerization processes be ``at the container or vessel used to collect or store the reacted polymer if subsequent drying is not required and the polymer is in a form amenable to its intended manufacturing purpose.''\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1741282681,"_task_hash":954359576,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Because the removal of 45CSR39 and 41 remove moot CAIR provisions which have been replaced by CSAPR which is at least as stringent as CAIR, the removal of 45CSR39 and 41 from the West Virginia SIP has no expected emissions impact on any pollutant and thus is not expected to interfere with reasonable further progress, any NAAQS or any other CAA requirement.

The first change is that the final compliance remedy now includes a heat input-based SO2 emission limit of 0.67 lb/mmBtu for units 1 and 2, in addition to the proposed SO2 emission rate limits. The heat- input based SO2 emission limit is based on a 30 boiler operating day rolling average. This additional requirement was made to address concerns raised by commenters that the proposed compliance remedy was not adequate to ensure attainment of the NAAQS in New Jersey.

Second, we proposed to mandate electronic reporting to EPA to make the process more efficient and to enable increased sharing of hazardous waste import and export data with state programs, the general public, and individual hazardous waste exporters and importers. Third, we proposed to require validation of the consent to export as part of the electronic export information submitted to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to provide for more efficient compliance monitoring of hazardous waste export shipments. Fourth, we proposed to require matching of waste stream level consent numbers with waste streams listed on the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste manifests for import and export shipments. Lastly, we proposed to require EPA identification (ID) numbers for those recognized traders \\1\\ arranging for export or import of hazardous waste.

This particular method focused on development of the SMC value based on the current capability of providing a meaningful measure of the pollutants. See relevant discussion later in this section and at 45 FR 52710. Options 2 and 3, called the ``PM2.5 to PM10 emissions ratio'' and the ``PM2.5 to PM10 NAAQS ratio,'' respectively, used the SMC for PM10 as the base for multiplying the emissions and NAAQS ratios to derive an SMC for PM2.5.

Some commenters went further in stating that Wyoming is given almost complete discretion in creating its regional haze SIP. These commenters argued that, because Wyoming is given such discretion, EPA lacks the statutory authority to disapprove the State's regional haze SIP. Specifically, some commenters pointed to the flexibility the State is granted in developing its BART determinations and other RHR requirements. The commenters stated that the CAA anticipates that EPA will create guidance and that the states, using their discretion, will use this guidance to develop regional haze SIPs. The State of Wyoming and other parties argued that each factor in the five-factor analysis used to make its BART determinations was appropriately weighed based on the State's own discretion. The commenters therefore argue that EPA has no basis on which to disapprove the five-factor analysis and that EPA does not have authority to reject a state's BART determination solely because EPA would have conducted the analysis in a different way or reached a different conclusion. The commenters went on to say that the State, after considering all statutory factors, made BART determinations for all subject-to-BART sources in a manner consistent with 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix Y, the established CAA requirements, and the interests of the State of Wyoming.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-672246697,"_task_hash":1115936426,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Drift is the off-site movement through the air of pesticide droplets or particles originating from pesticides applied as liquids or dry materials. Workers errantly in the area being treated may be directly exposed to pesticides during application. In addition, bystanders (both workers and non-workers) located outside a treated area may be exposed when pesticide droplets or particles move outside the area being treated through the air during and/or immediately after the pesticide application. As used here, the term ``drift'' includes both of these modes of exposure, but does not include off-site movement of pesticide- imbedded soil-borne particles by wind or vapor drift through volatilization of applied pesticide, although these are often categorized as ``drift'' in other contexts. EPA has developed methodologies for assessing the risks to bystanders from exposure to pesticides from drift and also from volatilization, and addresses risks of concern and other issues via the registration review process. The purpose of the requirements discussed in this section is to prevent workers and other persons from being exposed to pesticides by unintentional contact during application.

This revision does not change the status quo; it merely recognizes that first-time small MS4 permittees have up to five years to develop and implement their SWMPs, while small MS4s that have already been permitted will have developed and implemented their SWMPs when they reapply for permit coverage under an individual permit or submit an NOI under the next small MS4 general permit.

EPA characterized the wastewater generated by the industry and identified POCs (those pollutants commonly found) for each of the regulated wastestreams. For wastestreams where the final rule establishes numeric effluent limitations or standards, the POCs are those pollutants that have been quantified in a wastestream at sufficient frequency at treatable levels (concentrations). For wastestreams where EPA is establishing zero discharge limitations or standards, the POCs identified for each wastestream are those pollutants that are confirmed to be present at sufficient frequency in untreated wastewater samples of that wastestream. In both cases, in response to public comments, where EPA had available paired source water (intake water) data for a particular pollutant in an untreated process wastewater sample, EPA compared the two to confirm that the concentration in the untreated process wastewater sample exceeded that of the source water.

Given these new and revised definitions, the final rule modifies the structure of the previously established BPT regulations so that they specifically identify these four wastestreams, but without changing their applicable BPT limitations, which are equal to those for low volume waste sources.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1536917978,"_task_hash":929083033,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

If certain conditions are met, this change will allow certification of Stage II equipment using certification procedures other than the CARB procedures, as previously required. Today, EPA is also taking action to approve the component of the September 26, 2006, submittal (as clarified in the November 6, 2006, submittal) that modifies Georgia Air Quality Rule, Chapter 391-3-1-.02, paragraph (2) ``Emission Limitations and Standards,'' subparagraph (zz) ``Gasoline Dispensing Facilities--Stage II.'' As explained above, this rule was initially approved by EPA into the Georgia SIP on February 2, 1996, and requires owners or operators of gasoline dispensing systems to install and operate Stage II gasoline vapor recovery systems to recover the vapors from the fueling of motor vehicles. The current Georgia Air Quality Rule at 391-3-1-.02(2)(zz)2, exempts facilities used exclusively for the re-fueling of vehicles equipped with ORVR equipment. This exemption is being expanded today to cover initial fueling as well. Now, facilities used exclusively for the initial fueling and/or re-fueling of vehicles equipped with ORVR equipment are exempt.

Specifically, EPA has determined that under FIFRA a prion is considered to be a pest; thus, pursuant to the authority of FIFRA section 25(c)(1), EPA is declaring a prion to be a pest. For the same reasons, EPA is amending the regulatory definition of ``pests'' in 40 CFR 152.5 to expressly include ``prion.'' These actions make explicit the Agency's authority to regulate products distributed or sold for the purpose of reducing the infectivity of prions (i.e., prion-related products), other than prions on or in living humans or other living animals and those on or in processed food or processed animal feed, beverages, drugs (as defined in FFDCA section 201(g)(1)) and cosmetics (as defined in FFDCA section 201(i)). Prion-related products are already regulated under FIFRA and subject to all requirements and provisions of the Act based on EPA's September 10, 2003 decision (Ref. 1) that prions share enough characteristics of an ``other micro-organism'' or ``form of life'' (as those terms are used in FIFRA) to fall within the scope of FIFRA section 2(t) and 40 CFR 152.5(d). This rule ensures that the regulatory definition reflects the Agency's authority to regulate prion-related products. The primary impact of declaring that a prion is a pest and including ``prion'' in the regulatory definition of ``pest'' is to provide regulatory clarity that prion-related products must be registered under FIFRA sections 3 or 24(c), or otherwise exempted before such products may be distributed or sold in the United States.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-624054418,"_task_hash":862585833,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

The NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. In the 2006 Proposal, EPA proposed to adopt a number of work practice requirements that could be considered technical standards for performing renovation projects in residences that contain lead-based paint. As discussed in Unit VIII.I. of the 2006 Proposal, EPA identified two potentially applicable voluntary consensus standards (Ref. 3 at 1626). ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) has developed two potentially applicable documents: Standard Practice for Clearance Examinations Following Lead Hazard Reduction Activities in Single-Family Dwellings and Child- Occupied Facilities (Ref. 50), and ``Standard Guide for Evaluation, Management, and Control of Lead Hazards in Facilities'' (Ref. 51). With respect to the first document, EPA did not propose to require traditional clearance examinations, including dust sampling, following renovation projects. However, EPA did propose to require that a visual inspection for dust, debris, and residue be conducted after cleaning and before post-renovation cleaning verification is performed. The first ASTM document does contain information on conducting a visual inspection before collecting dust clearance samples. The second ASTM document is a comprehensive guide to identifying and controlling lead- based paint hazards. Some of the information in this document is relevant to the work practices required by the rule. Each of these ASTM documents represents state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the performance of these particular aspects of lead-based paint hazard evaluation and control practices and EPA continues to recommend the use of these documents where appropriate.

Under Sec.  260.20, any person may petition the EPA Administrator to modify or revoke any provision in parts 260 through 266, 267, 268, and 273 of 40 CFR. The CCC argued in its petition (which is included in the docket for this final rule) that the current scientific evidence, as viewed by key public health agencies, such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), does not support classifying saccharin as a potential human carcinogen, which was EPA's original and only basis for placing saccharin and its salts on its lists of hazardous constituents, hazardous wastes, and hazardous substances. EPA's evaluation of this petition considered the original basis for the listing, NTP's and IARC's more recent conclusions about the risk of carcinogenicity of saccharin and its salts, as well as other factors or criteria required for making a listing determination. Based on this evaluation, EPA determined that saccharin and its salts do not present a significant risk to human health or the environment. Therefore, EPA proposed to grant CCC's petition by proposing to remove saccharin and its salts from the lists of hazardous constituents (40 CFR part 261, Appendix VIII), hazardous wastes (40 CFR 261.33(f)), and hazardous substances (40 CFR 302.4).\n","EPA-HQ-RCRA-2006-0984-0139":"On January 18, 2007 (72 FR 2219), the Agency proposed to amend the list of hazardous wastes from non-specific sources (called F-wastes) under 40 CFR 261.31 by modifying the scope of the EPA Hazardous Waste No. F019 (Wastewater treatment sludges from the chemical conversion coating of aluminum except from zirconium phosphating in aluminum can washing when such phosphating is an exclusive conversion coating process).

In the preamble section IV.A, Summary of the Modeling for the Proposed Rule, the EPA inadvertently referred to four specific counties in New Jersey when discussing violations of the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS. The statement reads, ``The EPA also modeled the emissions from Portland using the AERMOD dispersion model and determined that the modeled concentrations from Portland, when combined with the relatively low background concentrations, cause violations of the 1-hour SO2 NAAQS in Morris, Sussex, Warren and Hunterdon Counties in New Jersey.'' (See id. at 69057.) This conclusion is not correctly stated as the EPA's modeling did not separately examine air quality in each of the four counties identified. A more accurate description of the EPA's conclusion was presented in the April 7, 2011, proposal (76 FR 19662 at 19680) which did not refer to those counties in our explanations of the modeling results.

After promulgation, EPA received a petition for reconsideration of certain provisions of the amended rule from the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG). UARG also filed a petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. EPA granted UARG's petition for reconsideration and intends to address the issues raised in the petition through a subsequent rulemaking. This direct final action addresses two specific issues raised by UARG. First, UARG asserts that the condensable PM testing requirements for owners/ operators of subpart Da affected facilities that elect to install PM CEMS to determine compliance with an applicable filterable PM standard are technically problematic in a number of respects and are not necessary in light of other actions taken by EPA subsequent to the promulgation of the January 2009 amendments. Second, UARG asserts that there is confusion regarding the implementation of the amended opacity monitoring provisions requiring owners/operators of affected subpart D facilities that are subject to an opacity standard, but do not use a COMS to measure opacity, to perform periodic visible emissions performance testing using EPA Method 9. This direct final rule amends specific provisions in subparts D and Da to address these issues. (The direct final rule also amends parallel provisions in subparts Db and Dc requiring owners/operators of affected facilities that are subject to an opacity standard, but do not use a COMS to measure opacity, to perform periodic visible emissions performance testing using EPA Method 9.) None of these changes will affect EPA's ability to implement and enforce the emission standards as EPA intended.

The relief from these obligations is sufficient reason to allow an expedited effective date of this rule under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). In addition, New York's relief from these obligations provides good cause to make this rule effective on January 24, 2008, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The purpose of the 30-day waiting period prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553(d) is to give affected parties a reasonable time to adjust their behavior and prepare before the final rule takes effect. Where, as here, the final rule relieves obligations rather than imposes obligations, affected parties, such as the State of New York and CAIR sources within the State, do not need time to adjust and prepare before the rule takes effect.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1470706860,"_task_hash":-23903099,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

EPA (618 F.3d 1, D.C. Cir. 2010). As discussed in this preamble and in the proposed rule (77 FR 237), the Court vacated HCFC- 22 and HCFC-142b company-by-company baseline and calendar-year allowances for 2012-2014. Baselines and calendar-year allowances for these two substances were originally finalized in a December 15, 2009, rule (``2009 Final Rule,'' 74 FR 66412).\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0496-0145":"In this action, EPA is amending the existing regulations to implement the next major milestone in the HCFC phaseout.

Our domestic chemical-by-chemical approach results in differing schedules for the phaseout of individual HCFCs. EPA believes that the chemical-by-chemical allocation of HCFC allowances ensures that the United States continues to maintain an overall HCFC production and consumption level that is below the 2010 cap specified by the September 2007 Montreal Adjustment, while at the same time ensuring that servicing needs consistent with section 605(a) of the Clean Air Act and EPA's implementing regulations continue to be met. Thus, the aggregate allowances for all U.S. HCFC consumption in the years 2010- 2014 do not exceed 3,810 ODP-weighted metric tons (25 percent of the aggregate U.S. consumption baseline) annually and the aggregate allowances for all U.S. HCFC production in the years 2010-2014 do not exceed 3,884.25 ODP-weighted metric tons (25 percent of the aggregate U.S. production baseline) annually.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0263-0121":"This action amends the existing regulations to implement the next major milestone in the HCFC phaseout.

Affected sources appear to be well-controlled, and our GACT determination reflects such controls. We estimate that the only impacts associated with this rule are the capital and annual costs of installing and operating a particulate control device, the capital cost of adding lids or covers to process vessels, and the compliance requirements (i.e., reporting, recordkeeping, and testing).\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0236-0050":"Existing aluminum, copper, and other nonferrous foundries are currently well controlled, and our final GACT determination reflects such controls. Compared to 1990, when the baseline emissions were established, these sources have improved their level of control and reduced emissions due to State permitting requirements, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations (particularly for lead), and actions taken to improve efficiency and reduce costs. We estimate that the only impacts associated with the final rule are the compliance requirements (i.e., monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping, and testing).\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0154-0052":"Affected sources are well-controlled and our GACT determination reflects such controls. Compared to the early 1990s when we evaluated this industry as part of the development of the major source rule, we believe that sources have improved their level of control and reduced emissions due to State permitting requirements or actions taken to improve efficiency and/or reduce costs. For example, sources have reported improved capture of tapping emissions, improved process controls that minimize upset conditions, and installed improvements in fabric filter technology such as Goretex[supreg] bags. We estimate that the only impact associated with this final rule is for the compliance requirements (monitoring, reporting, recordkeeping and testing), which is estimated to be approximately $3,600 per facility.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2008-0080-0068":"We project that the baseline PM emissions from the estimated 1,800 facilities in the prepared feeds source category are approximately 11,000 tons/yr, with approximatley 11,000 tons/yr of PM2.5, 195 tons/yr of manganese and just over 8 tons/yr of chromium. We believe that management practices are already being implemented throughout the industry. Therefore, we do not expect any additional reductions in chromium compound, manganese compound, or general PM emissions from these measures. We estimate that the requirement to install cyclones on the pelleting processes at the facilities with average daily feed production levels exceeding 50 tpd will result in emission reductions of around 1,100 tons/yr of PM, 100 tons/yr of PM2.5, and approximately 20 tons/yr of manganese and chromium emissions. While cyclones do remove PM from the air stream, these solids are typically recycled back to the process. Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant indirect or secondary air impacts of this rule as proposed. In addition, we do not expect any non-air health, environmental, or energy impacts.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":571045297,"_task_hash":1985380102,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

The impacts associated with the Boiler MACT are discussed in detail in the January 2013 final amendments to the Boiler MACT.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0238-0053":"The environmental and cost impacts for this final rule are presented in Table 2 of this preamble:\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0451-0202":"For most Emission Guidelines, the EPA analyzes the impacts in the year the standard is implemented. If the Emission Guidelines are promulgated and published in August 2016, then the implementation year would be 2017 based on the following: states have 9 months to prepare a state plan implementing the guidelines (May 2017); the EPA has 4 months to review the plan (September 2017); and if necessary, the state has an additional 2 months to revise and submit a corrected plan based on any comments from the EPA (November 2017). Concurrently, the EPA must promulgate a federal plan within 6 months after the state plan is due, consistent with 40 CFR 60.27(d), or November 2017. Thus, the EPA- approved state plan and updated federal plan implementing the Emission Guidelines are expected to become effective in November 2017. Although late 2017 is the estimated implementation year, the reporting and control timeframe allows 3 months to submit the first NMOC emission report and then 30 months after reporting the NMOC emission rate results before the GCCS is required to be installed. Therefore, the first year that affected landfills could have controls installed under the final rule will be late 2020.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2003-0215-0210":"For most NSPS, impacts are expressed 5 years after the effective date of the rule. However, for the landfills NSPS, impacts are expressed 10 years after the effective date (year 2025) because the landfills regulations require controls at a given landfill only after the NMOC emission rate reaches the level of the regulatory threshold, which may take a number of years. Further, once the NMOC emission rate is exceeded, the reporting and control timeframe allows 3 months to submit the first NMOC emission report and then 30 months after exceeding the NMOC emission threshold before the GCCS is required to be installed. Additionally, the regulations allow the collection and control devices to be capped or removed at each landfill after certain criteria are met, which includes having the GCCS operate a minimum of 15 years. Controls would not be required over the same time period for all landfills. The impacts are a direct result of control; therefore, the annualized impacts change from year to year. By 2025, over 80 percent of the greenfield landfills and modified landfills affected by the NSPS are expected to have installed controls and thus, the EPA considered the impacts of the final rule relative to the baseline in 2025.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":334944039,"_task_hash":-1630665361,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

We accomplish this by tailoring the applicability criteria that determine which GHG emission sources become subject to the PSD and title V programs \\1\\ of the CAA. In particular, EPA is establishing with this rulemaking a phase-in approach for PSD and title V applicability, and is establishing the first two steps of the phase-in for the largest emitters of GHGs. We also commit to certain follow-up actions regarding future steps beyond the first two, discussed in more detail later. Our legal basis for this rule is our interpretation of the PSD and title V applicability provisions under the familiar Chevron \\2\\ two-step framework for interpreting administrative statutes, taking account of three legal doctrines, both separately and interdependently: They are what we will call (1) The ``absurd results'' doctrine, which authorizes agencies to apply statutory requirements differently than a literal reading would indicate, as necessary to effectuate congressional intent and avoid absurd results, (2) the ``administrative necessity'' doctrine, which authorizes agencies to apply statutory requirements in a way that avoids impossible administrative burdens; and (3) the ``one- step-at-a-time'' doctrine, which authorizes agencies to implement statutory requirements a step at a time. This legal basis justifies each of the actions we take with this rule--e.g., each of the first two steps of the phase-in approach--both (1) as part of the overall tailoring approach, and (2) independently of each other action we take with this rule.

The commenter has two concerns with this requirement. First, it is not clear which rule applies to the production of materials that have both coating and non- coating uses. Second, some coating manufacturing processes involve traditional chemical manufacturing operations, including reactions, which differ significantly from the processes consisting of mixing and blending operations that were used to develop the maximum achievable control technology (MACT) floor and regulatory requirements in 40 CFR part 63, subpart HHHHH.

This final action was developed following a CAA section 111(b)(1)(B) review of the 1988 promulgated subpart AAA (53 FR 5860, February 26, 1988), i.e., the 1988 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS). Section 111 requires the EPA to establish standards based on best systems of emission reduction (BSER). Section 111(b) requires emission standards for affected sources and section 111(h)(2)(B) allows the EPA to establish work practices and operational standards or combinations of standards in certain cases, such as when testing is impractical due to technological or economic limitations. The current body of evidence strongly supports revision of the 1988 NSPS to capture the technology improvements and enhanced performance of such units since 1988 and to expand the applicability of these standards to include additional wood-burning residential heating devices that are available today. Section 111 requires the EPA to consider costs and economic impacts. The potential impact on this industry that is comprised of over 90 percent small businesses was a concern to the EPA, and we have minimized these potential impacts to the degree possible while still achieving significant emission reductions. For example, we have incorporated stepped (phased) emission limits and streamlined certification procedures to ease the transition.

In this section, we provide state rate-based goals and mass-based goals that can be used in the alternative, by states, as an equivalent quantitative expression of the BSER in establishing standards of performance for affected EGUs in state plans. In this section, the EPA also describes reasons for providing state- specific rate-based goals and mass-based goals equivalent to the emission performance rates, supported by the many requests from commenters for the provision of these alternative expressions of the BSER established by the EPA. We further ensure this equivalence, and therefore reflection of the BSER, by requiring that rate-based state goals and mass-based state goals fully implement the BSER, including by ensuring that affected EGUs operating under mass-based emission standards are not incented by dint of the mass-emissions constraint to shift generation to unaffected fossil fuel-fired sources to an extent that deviates from, or negates, the implementation of the BSER.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2005-0161-0002":"Section 1501 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Energy Act or the Act) amended the Clean Air Act by adding a new provision establishing a national renewable fuel program (also commonly known as the Renewable Fuel Standard program, or RFS program).

Because this action does not impose any additional enforceable duty beyond that required by state law, it does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4). This action also does not have tribal implications because it will not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action also does not have Federalism implications because it does not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government, as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999). This action merely approves the negative declaration for existing HMIWI units from the Philadelphia AMS and does not alter the relationship or the distribution of power and responsibilities established in the Clean Air Act. This action also is not subject to Executive Order 13045 ``Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks'' (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997), because it is not economically significant.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1468871718,"_task_hash":-777629020,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Airborne PM can be comprised of either solid or liquid particles, and can be a complex mixture of particles in both solid and liquid form. The most common constituents of airborne PM include the following: Sulfate (SO4); nitrate (NO3); ammonium (NH4); elemental carbon (EC); organic mass (OM); and inorganic material, generally referred to as ``crustal'' material, which can include metals, dust, sea salt and other trace elements. Airborne PM can be of different sizes, commonly referred to as ``coarse'' and ``fine'' particles. Fine particles, in general terms, are PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 2.5 micrometers ([micro]m). For this reason, particles of this size are referred to as PM2.5. PM2.5 particles commonly include ``primary'' particles and ``secondary'' particles. Primary particles, or direct PM2.5, are emitted by sources directly into the air as solid or liquid particles (e.g., elemental carbon from diesel engines or wildfires, or condensable organic particles from gasoline engines). Secondary particles are formed in the atmosphere as a result of chemical reactions between specific pollutants known as PM2.5 precursors (e.g., reactions between NOX and SO2 emissions from mobile and stationary sources combined with ammonia to form ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate).\n","EPA-HQ-SFUND-2005-0011-0032":"EPA Region 5 is publishing this Direct Final Notice of Deletion of the Eau Claire Municipal Well Field Superfund Site from the National Priorities List (NPL) and requests public comments on this proposed action.

In addition, if the steam generating unit is subject to federally enforceable permit conditions limiting the amount of fossil fuel combusted in the steam generating unit to an annual capacity factor of 10 percent or less, the steam generating unit is not subject to NOX emission limits under the NSPS when it simultaneously combusts fossil fuel and byproduct/waste.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2011-0044-5852":"On February 16, 2012, the final MATS and the Utility NSPS rules were published in the Federal Register. 77 FR 9304.

Approximately, a third expressed support for nationwide approval of the ASTM D7575 method as an alternative oil and grease method. In general, these comments were similar to those received on EPA's proposal: ASTM D7575 is ``green'' (e.g., less hazardous waste, no exposure to toxic chemicals), it is easier, faster, less expensive and potentially portable in comparison to EPA 1664A, and it produces results substantially in agreement with Method 1664A. About two-thirds of the comments recommended EPA not approve it for use as an alternative oil and grease method. Some comments were specific to the sampling requirements and sample preparation procedures of the method, raising technical concerns such as the representativeness of the 10 mL aliquot and concerns over the drying procedures. Some comments were more overarching such as comments that ASTM D7575 had not been tested in a sufficient number of matrices. Others were specific to the consideration of the ASTM D7575 method as an alternative to EPA method 1664A, such as the applicable range of the ASTM D7575 method (5 to 200 mg/L) was limited in comparison to EPA Method 1664A. Some noted that the ASTM method did not produce statistically comparable results to EPA Method 1664A and EPA should retain its policy not to approve alternative methods for method-defined parameters that are not based on the same determinative step. Finally, many shared the concerns raised in the notice about implementing ASTM D7575 on a nationwide basis as an alternative oil and grease method and the possibility that a discharger could be in or out of compliance simply by changing the method.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":469228451,"_task_hash":-1594337375,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Numerous commenters disliked the proposed requirement to calculate data uncertainty in the method results and thought it inappropriate and confusing. It was noted that existing emission limitations were developed using emission data derived principally from these same test methods with no consideration of uncertainty. Further, the purpose of the Federal test methods is to provide a means of demonstrating compliance with the applicable requirements on the basis of the test method results. Most commenters objected to allowing regulatory agencies (or data end users) the discretion of accepting data close to an emission limit if the uncertainty determination is questionable, especially since no criteria for acceptable uncertainty were identified. The commenters thought that measurement uncertainty and data quality objectives present a number of very serious issues that are too easy for those without a thorough understanding of statistics to misapply. The resulting gray areas would incite many frivolous lawsuits by those who would use the perception of uncertainty to continuously challenge any decision made related to compliance. The commenters noted that the proposed revisions failed to provide a definition for uncertainty and the proposed uncertainty calculation reflected only two factors (sampling system bias and converter efficiency) that contribute to uncertainty, rather than all potential measurement factors. They preferred the tester and facility have a reasonable assurance that they have met the test requirements based on a properly quality assured test, not on an untenable uncertainty calculation.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1312951719,"_task_hash":2050430870,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

With respect to Regulatory Planning and Review (Executive Order 12866), the proposed FIP stated that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' and is not a rule of general applicability. CPC stated that the proposed FIP will have an adverse material effect on several sectors of the economy, in particular the cement and copper industries, and includes requirements that have statewide, general applicability. According to CPC, one of the provisions of Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to consider alternatives. CPC stated that had the Proposed FIP considered and evaluated alternatives, such as deferring controls on CPC during this first planning period, then it would be possible to conduct a full and fair evaluation to see if the benefits are worth the costs. Without this analysis of alternatives, CPC believes the proposed FIP is incomplete. Regarding the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), CPC asserted that given the extremely high costs to comply with the rule (about $81,000,000 for the Hayden Smelter alone), it is likely that the aggregate costs will exceed the $100,000,000 threshold in at least one year. Similarly, according to CPC, when combined with the BART controls imposed by the FIP on three power plants, annual expenditures will exceed the UMRA's threshold ``in any one year.'' CPC stated EPA should not circumvent UMRA by subdividing a regulatory action, in this case the adoption of a FIP, into multiple parts. Regarding Executive Order 13563, CPC asserted that EPA must redo the proposed FIP to establish new RPGs, and identify controls as necessary to meet the RPGs. As part of that process, Executive Order 13563 should be followed so that EPA identifies and uses the best, most innovative, and least burdensome tools to achieve reasonable progress. CPC asserted that complying with the statutes and Executive Orders governing the rulemaking process is good public policy and the decision to disregard these principles has led to arbitrary and capricious results.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":2102706095,"_task_hash":-838249151,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

The process would be voluntary and available in addition to the two self-implementing exclusions. EPA proposed three types of non-waste determinations: (1) For hazardous secondary materials reclaimed in a continuous industrial process; (2) for hazardous secondary materials indistinguishable in all relevant aspects from a product or intermediate; and (3) for hazardous secondary materials reclaimed under the control of the generator, such as through contracts similar to tolling arrangements. For each type of non-waste determination, EPA proposed a set of criteria which the hazardous secondary materials would have to meet in order to receive a formal non-waste determination from the regulatory authority.

{"text":"Individual State Comments","meta":{"# of occurrences: ":"1\n","EPA-HQ-RCRA-2009-0640-11970":"EPA also received a significant number of comments from individual states. In their comments, many of the states addressed selected damage cases that occurred within their jurisdiction, subject to their authority. Several states agreed with EPA's assessment of the damage cases; for instance, Wisconsin and Michigan complimented EPA's database of damage cases. Other commenters agreed with some of the newly alleged damage cases' reports of groundwater contamination exceeding regulatory standards, but disagreed with EIP's conclusions that enforcement was inadequate, tardy, or absent. According to some state commenters, enforcement was not necessary or appropriate in those instances. For example, some states (e.g., North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Florida) argued that the contamination did not pose public health risks because the contaminants were confined to state-established Compliance Boundaries (known also as Groundwater Mixing Zones) \\203\\ and/or because there was no evidence the contamination had migrated off-site. Several other states (e.g., Maryland, Virginia, and Texas) confirmed EPA's established damage cases as well as some of the newly alleged damage cases, but claimed that these cases were associated with presently outdated practices, and that regulatory requirements have since been revised to prohibit such practices. Two states (South Dakota and Pennsylvania) confirmed that contamination above federal or state regulatory standards had occurred, but attributed the contaminant(s) to sources other than CCR units, e.g., coal mining pits associated with coal refuse; and/or nearby, up-gradient unlined MSWLFs, cooling water evaporation ponds, or natural background soil compositions. For certain cases, the states explained that required assessment monitoring was still ongoing to establish the source, scope, and extent of the contamination, and so had reached no conclusions about the specific allegations (North Carolina, North Dakota, and Tennessee). Finally Ohio acknowledged that the extent of groundwater contamination risk within the state is poorly-documented due to the scarcity of monitoring wells down gradient from unlined disposal units.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1406296624,"_task_hash":834235372,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

The commenter argued that the BART Reassessment is inconsistent with the EPA's long-standing interpretation of section 110(l) of the CAA as preventing implementation plan revisions that would increase overall air pollution or worsen air quality. The commenter stated that the effect of the BART Assessment would be to allow Units 3 and 4 to emit an additional 4,161 tons of NOX per year every year between 2018 and 2024, and would result in worse visibility conditions than the existing BART determination. The commenter went on to assert that the EPA's conclusions that the BART Reassessment complies with 110(l) are not justified because the EPA inappropriately discounted the timing of pollution reductions and the importance of promptly reducing pollution and improving visibility. The commenter argued that it is contrary to the purposes of the regional haze program and 110(l) to trade worse air quality and increased air pollution in the short term for potential benefits that may arise years from now.

The Commenter cites to CAA section 302(k) which requires that emission limits must limit the quantity, rate or concentration of emissions and must apply on a continuous basis. The Commenter states that ``Enforceable emission limitations contained in the I-SIP must, therefore, be accompanied by proper averaging times; otherwise an appropriate numerical emission limit could allow for peak emissions that exceed the NAAQS and yet still be permitted since they would be averaged with lower emissions at other times.'' The Commenter also cites to recommended averaging times in EPA guidance providing that SIP emissions limits, ``should not exceed the averaging time of the applicable NAAQS that the limit is intended to help attain.'' EPA Memorandum of Apr. 23, 2014, to Regional Air Division Directors, Regions 1-10, Guidance for 1-Hour SO2 NAAQS Nonattainment Area SIP Submissions, at 22, available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/20140423guidance_nonattainment_sip.pdf. The Commenter also notes that this EPA guidance provides that `` `any emissions limits based on averaging periods longer than 1 hour should be designed to have comparable stringency to a 1-hour average limit at the critical emission value.' '' The Commenter states that, ``. . . for Tennessee's Infrastructure SIP to rely on enforceable emission limitations for implementation of the SO2 NAAQS which employ an averaging period longer than one-hour, the numerical emission limits must be ratcheted down to provide adequate assurance that the NAAQS will be met.''

The new method requires persons to report under the IUR if they manufactured (including imported) 25,000 lb or more of a chemical substance at any single site in any calendar year since the last principal reporting year. This method becomes effective after the 2012 submission period. (Note: There is also a lowered production volume threshold for certain chemical substances, effective after the 2012 submission period. See 40 CFR 711.8(b).) Several commenters believed the change is appropriate and should be implemented for the submission period following the upcoming submission period (i.e., in the submission period following the 2011 submission period described in the proposed rule). They noted that the new requirement is essential to effectively capture the substantial year-to-year fluctuation in production/import volumes that was missed in past IUR reporting cycles, thereby skewing the picture of how many and which chemical substances are actually in commerce at a given time and what levels of production or import. One commenter went further to say that the modification would eliminate gaps and uncertainties in the information collected under the current IUR that result from infrequent collections and reporting of data. Another said that this will keep manufacturers from disguising their actual output by producing certain specialty chemical substances only in years that are not currently subject to IUR reporting. Two commenters supported the change but opposed the proposal to delay implementation until after the 2011 submission period described in the proposed rule, because it would further delay the ability to obtain accurate annual production information.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":577343410,"_task_hash":-1573876105,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

The Commenter cites to CAA section 302(k) which requires that emission limits must limit the quantity, rate or concentration of emissions and must apply on a continuous basis. The Commenter states that ``[e]nforceable emission limitations contained in the I-SIP must, therefore, be accompanied by proper averaging times; otherwise an appropriate numerical emission limit could allow for peaks that exceed the NAAQS and yet still be permitted since they would be averaged with lower emissions at other times.'' The Commenter also cites to recommended averaging times in EPA guidance providing that SIP emissions limits, ``should not exceed the averaging time of the applicable NAAQS that the limit is intended to help attain.'' EPA Memorandum of April 23, 2014, to Regional Air Division Directors, Regions 1-10, Guidance for 1-Hour SO2 NAAQS Nonattainment Area SIP Submissions, at 22, available at https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/20140423guidance_nonattainment_sip.pdf.

Commenters claim that EPA's action ``breaks with its long-standing interpretation that an attainment SIP must include currently adopted emissions limitations and other control measures'' that achieve the needed emissions reductions. Specifically, commenters state that CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A) and 172(c)(6) require SIPs to contain ``enforceable emission limitations * * * as may be necessary or appropriate'' to achieve attainment. Commenters note that CAA section 110(k)(4) allows EPA to grant ``conditional approval'' of a SIP lacking certain statutory elements ``based on a commitment of the state to adopt specific enforceable measures'' by a certain date, and that this provision provides that the conditional approval automatically becomes a disapproval if the State fails to comply with the commitment within one year. Commenters state that courts have rejected similar attempts to circumvent the statute's limitations on conditional approvals and cite Sierra Club v. EPA, 356 F.3d 296, 298 (DC Cir. 2004) as overturning EPA's conditional approval of SIPs based in part on the fact that the commitments identified no specific measures the state would implement. In further support of their assertions that EPA may not allow States to submit ``promises to develop unspecified future enforceable measures as a substitute for'' enforceable control measures, the commenters reference CAA sections 107(a), 110(a)(1), 110(a)(2)(A), 110(a)(2)(C), the nonattainment plan requirements of part D, title I of the Act, EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51, and EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments (57 FR 13498, 13567 (April 16, 1992).\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1033135894,"_task_hash":547596145,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

In Earthjustice's opinion, in order to conduct a thorough reasonable progress analysis in this case where there was limited information available, EPA should have obtained the data necessary to conduct a proper analysis.

One commenter wrote ``It is difficult even for organized groups to constantly scan the local newspaper for publication notices. To have our rights for participation denied because we do not have time to peruse the local newspaper each and every day seems contrary to EPA's mission to inform and protect the public.'' Another commenter wrote ``The currently required method of publishing notices in `major local newspapers of general circulation' is antiquated and frequently ineffective. By broadening the permitted methods of notification, linked when possible to Community Involvement Plans, EPA can better reach populations affected by the Superfund process.'' A third commenter wrote ``The proposed rule would broaden the notification methods the lead agency will be able to use in order to adopt a notification approach that is most effective at informing a community. . . .

Also, we received comments questioning the legality and existence of Section VI along with requests for its removal from the Code of Federal Regulations. Such comments are outside the scope of this action. Section VI significantly predates the Phase 2 Rule. While it originally applied only to secondary NAAQS, EPA revised it to include primary standards following the 1977 Amendments (44 FR 3274, Jan. 16, 1979). EPA made an additional revision to Section VI in 1980 in the course of clarifying the applicability of Appendix S to sources located outside of nonattainment areas that cause or contribute to violations (45 FR 31307, May 13, 1980). The version of Section VI established by that 1980 rulemaking remained current up until the effective date of EPA's final Phase 2 rule. The time for challenging rules issued in 1979 and 1980 is long past. If commenters believe Section VI as a whole is no longer desirable, then the appropriate vehicle for their concerns is a petition for rulemaking.

Congress placed primary responsibility for developing SIPs on the states, so permitting programs among states can vary greatly. EPA determines whether the state SIP satisfies the minimum requirements of the CAA. Union Electric Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246 (1976), rehearing denied 429 U.S. 873 (1976); Train v. NRDC, 421 U.S. 60 (1975); Florida Power and Light Co. v. Costle, 650 F.2d 586 (5th Cir. 1979); 71 FR 48696, 486700 (August 21, 2006) (Proposed rule to promulgate a FIP under the CAA for tribes in Indian country). The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently stated that ``EPA has no authority to question the wisdom of a State's choice of emission limitations if they are part of a SIP that otherwise satisfies the standards set for in 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).'' Clean Coalition v. TXU Power, 536 F.3d 469 Fn.3 (5th Cir. Tex. 2008). Texas's permitting programs are based on the recognized Minor NSR flexibility and consistent with prior EPA approvals of other state SIPs. EPA must review other approved state programs to ensure that Texas's sources are not put at a competitive disadvantage. See Memorandum from John Seitz, Director, OAQPS, SIP Consistency Process (April 4, 10, 1996). EPA's proposed disapprovals could have dramatic impact on industries in Texas. EPA should solicit comments from all EPA regions on whether the proposed actions are inconsistent with other state SIPs and compare the stringency of the Texas programs to those of other states.

This ``interstate transport'' prong requires that SIPs be adopted to prohibit any source from emitting pollution which will ``(I) contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard, or (II) interfere with measures required to be included in the applicable implementation plan for any other state under part C of this subchapter to prevent significant deterioration of air quality or to protect visibility.'' The commenter points out that EPA issued a finding that Nebraska failed to submit an interstate transport SIP to address the 1997 ozone and particulate matter NAAQS, after which Nebraska submitted an interstate transport SIP submittal, and EPA approved it, stating, ``At this time, it is not possible for NDEQ to accurately determine whether there is interference with measures in another state's SIP designed to protect visibility, which is the fourth element that was addressed. Technical projects relating to visibility degradation are under development. Nebraska will be in a more advantageous position to address the visibility projection requirements once the initial regional haze SIP has been developed.'' 72 FR 71246 (Dec. 17, 2007).

We have concluded that these comments are not germane to the treatment variance and addressed an issue outside the scope of this rulemaking. The third comment supported granting the site-specific treatment variance to EnergySolutions. The final comment raised concerns about radioactive waste being treated in Utah and EPA's determination that the only regulated entity that would be affected by the rule would be EnergySolutions (see 73 FR at 12044). The commenter argued that EnergySolutions was not the only affected party and stated that the commenter, the State of Utah, and the United States would be affected by granting this treatment variance. The commenter, however, did not state why or how these entities would be affected. While the commenter's assertion that citizens, the States, and the federal government could be affected by this action may be correct in the broadest sense, we believe that it has no relation to the narrow question at issue here of whether the criteria for a treatment variance are satisfied. However, EPA believes firmly that no entities will be adversely affected by granting the treatment variance. First, EnergySolutions is a permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facility and is subject to regulations and permit conditions which assure protection of human health and the environment. Second, the unchallenged record indicates that EnergySolutions' method of treatment fully satisfies the criterion for a treatment variance; that is, the method of treatment is one that minimizes threats to human health and the environment posed by land disposal of the wastes being treated.\\8\\\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":2059968693,"_task_hash":108712807,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Based on the terms of an April 24, 2006 consent decree settling an enforcement case for MRYS, if EPA disagreed with the State's BACT determination, EPA had the burden of demonstrating to the court that North Dakota's BACT determination was unreasonable. EPA did disagree with North Dakota's BACT determination and challenged that determination in federal district court.

Most of the commenters supported the adoption of the second option believing that it was most consistent with the 1990 CAA Amendments and that it would ensure that at least three full ozone seasons of data following designation (2013-2015) would be used for Marginal areas (and six (2013-2018) for Moderate areas, etc.) to determine attainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Those opposing the second option indicated it would result in further delays in implementing controls in areas required to attain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and that it arbitrarily endangers human health.

EPA agrees that the issue of pesticides and their degradates is an important one and will consider, in future contaminant selection processes, the commenters' concern about the requirement that pesticides be registered. EPA did not receive comments on its health effects prioritization process.\n","EPA-HQ-OW-2009-0090-0097":"EPA received six (6) comments concerning UCMR monitoring based on retail population served. The commenters all agreed that applicability should be based on retail population, although some wanted to exclude those who purchase their water from that applicability. In UCMR 1 and 2, systems that purchased 100% of their water were excluded from monitoring, making estimates of exposure more difficult because many of these purchasing systems represented high-population areas. For UCMR 3, systems that purchase 100% of their water and serve greater than 10,000 people are subject to this rule. Wholesalers that serve a retail population of 10,000 or fewer customers are only required to monitor if they are selected as part of the nationally representative sample of small systems for any list of UCMR contaminants. This should greatly improve exposure estimates for UCMR 3 since exposure estimates will be based on the monitoring data collected from where the water is consumed rather than where it is sold. Between the wholesaler and the purchasing system, contaminant levels may increase (e.g., DBPs or metals) or decrease (e.g., through blending various sources or degradation/ chemical reactions).\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":819399354,"_task_hash":732686369,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Instead, the commenter states that EPA should grant full and unconditional approval of the Virginia Regional Haze SIP. The commenter disagreed that CAIR renders the State's SIP unable to satisfy all of the CAA's regional haze SIP requirements. The commenter noted that Virginia's SIP was submitted prior to the remand of CAIR and relied on the requirements under 40 CFR 51.308(e)(4), which remain in effect at this time. The commenter argued that as a result, the Virginia SIP is entirely consistent with the applicable law. The commenter also argued that if the D.C. Circuit invalidates the cross state air pollution rule (CSAPR), EPA's limited disapprovals of regional haze SIPs due to their reliance on the CAIR equals best available retrofit technology (BART) provision of the regional haze rules will have created unnecessary complications for states that should properly be able to continue their reliance on CAIR.

Many commenters requested that EPA establish a minimum age of 18 for handlers and early-entry workers. Commenters cited several reasons for their request. First, many commenters noted that adolescents' bodies are still developing and they may be more susceptible to the effects of pesticide exposure. Second, commenters noted that adolescents are less mature and their judgment is not as well developed as that of adults. This immaturity may mean that adolescents may be less consistently aware of risks associated with handling pesticides or entering a treated area while an REI is in effect, that they may not adequately protect themselves or other workers from known risks, and that spills, splashes, and improper handling practices may be more likely. A few commenters submitted studies related to development of maturity and decision-making skills in adolescents in support of this assertion. Third, commenters asserted that restricting handling activities to persons at least 18 years old could result in higher potential economic benefit from avoiding exposure and any potentially related chronic effects to children, because they have a longer potential life span. Fourth, because information on the potential chronic effects of pesticide exposure on developing systems is not known, commenters recommended that EPA prohibit adolescents from handling pesticides and entering treated areas while an REI is in effect as a precaution until it can be shown that they would not suffer adverse chronic effects from potential exposure. Finally, a few commenters noted that persons under 18 years old are protected in other industries by OSHA and should receive similar protections under the WPS, and that some states have already prohibited handling of pesticides in agriculture by anyone under 18 years old.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2006-0735-5909":"EPA received only one comment on the proposed revision to the schedule for flagging and documenting exceptional event data which could affect Pb designation decisions.

In addition, SO2 emissions oxidize in the atmosphere to form sulfates, which are one of the largest contributors to the formation of regional haze, which impairs visibility in the atmosphere by the scattering and absorption of sunlight by fine particles. Visibility impairment reduces the clarity, color, and visible distance that one can see. The District asserts its regulations limiting sulfur content in fuel oil used by certain fuel combustion sources and the prohibition of combustion of high sulfur content fuel oil within the District will decrease SO2 emissions and therefore strengthen the District's SIP. The reduction in SO2 emissions helps the District to maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for SO2 and PM2.5. Additional SO2 emission reductions and subsequent reductions in sulfates from District sources combusting lower sulfur fuel will assist the District in achieving further reasonable progress towards reducing regional haze.

The primary objective of state and federal regulators is to ensure that sources of emissions are subject to appropriate emission controls as necessary in order to attain and maintain the NAAQS, protect PSD increments, improve visibility and meet other statutory requirements.

This rulemaking is commonly referred to as the ``March, 2010 RFS2 final rule''. As part of the March, 2010 RFS2 final rule we analyzed various categories of biofuels to determine whether the complete lifecycle GHG emissions (domestic and international) associated with the production, distribution, and use of those fuels meet minimum lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction thresholds as specified in CAA section 211(o) (i.e., 60% for cellulosic biofuel, 50% for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel, and 20% for other renewable fuels). Our final rule focused our lifecycle analyses on fuels that were anticipated to contribute relatively large volumes of renewable fuel by 2022 and thus did not cover all fuels that either are contributing or could potentially contribute to the program. In the preamble to the final rule, EPA indicated that it had not completed the GHG emissions impact analysis for several specific biofuel production pathways but that this work would be completed through supplemental rulemaking processes. Since the final rule was issued, we have continued to examine several additional pathways. On June 12, 2012, we published a Notice of Data Availability Concerning Renewable Fuels Produced From Grain Sorghum Under the RFS Program (see 77 FR 34915). In that notice of data availability, we provided an opportunity for comment on EPA's analysis of grain sorghum used as a feedstock to produce ethanol under the RFS program. Today's final rule describes our lifecycle analysis of ethanol made from grain sorghum (``grain sorghum ethanol'') and presents our determination that grain sorghum ethanol qualifies as renewable fuel (20% lifecycle GHG reduction as compared to baseline fuel) or as advanced biofuel (50% lifecycle GHG reduction as compared to baseline fuel) if produced pursuant to specified pathways. The modeling approach EPA used in this analysis is the same general approach used in the March, 2010 RFS2 final rule for lifecycle analyses of other biofuels.\\1\\ The March, 2010 RFS2 final rule preamble and Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) provides further discussion of our approach.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-325935927,"_task_hash":-904617679,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Several commenters suggested that data submitted through the ERT is error-prone and imposes additional burdens on reporting sources. Some commenters asserted that EPA provides no insight or justification in the preamble or otherwise for requiring this form of data submittal and that the cost of this requirement, as compared to conventional reporting, is not evaluated or disclosed in discussion of the cost and impact of the proposed rule. Commenters state that many of the affected facilities have not had to participate in such reporting procedures in the past, and that these facilities will require additional staff time, equipment, and training to accomplish this requirement.

The original prescription language generally states that the work assignment clause, 1552.211-74, shall be used when a Cost Reimbursable type term form contract with work assignments will be issued. This policy revision only adds additional instructive language. The new policy language contained under 1511.011-74, Work Assignments (Deviation), will serve to provide contracting officers with better guidance on issuing a work assignment. Therefore a revision will not be required to the related EPAAR clause, 1552.211-74 Work Assignments; as this change does not affect the meaning of the clause. The revised language communicates to contract personnel and program staff that government cost-related estimates should not be provided to contractors prior to receiving the contractor's work plan (proposal); and how to address exceptions. The exceptions addressed in the policy involve circumstances where a contracting officer may need to be able to provide some of the expected level of service needed to the contractor prior to receipt of the work plan (proposal) due to the nature of the work.\n","EPA-HQ-RCRA-2005-0017-0224":"On December 8, 2009, EPA proposed to withdraw the conditional exclusion for ECF under 261.38, including the exclusion itself in Sec. 261.38(a), the specifications and associated conditions applicable to ECF under Sec.  261.38(a), the implementation conditions applicable to ECF under Sec.  261.38(b), the storage and burning conditions for ECF under Sec.  261.38(c), the provisions for failure to comply with the conditions for the ECF exclusion under Sec.  261.38(d)(2), the alternative storage conditions for ECF under Sec.  261.38(e), and the notification of closure of an ECF storage unit under Sec.  261.38(f).

This includes all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information. This chemical will be applied as a fungicide to agricultural food crops and as a post-harvest treatment to stored potatoes at 35,600 ppm or less. There is very little potential for dietary exposure to phosphorous acid, exposure in drinking water, and from non-dietary, non- occupational exposures. Once released into the environment, the chemical rapidly dissociates to form hydrogen and phosphite ions, important nutrients for plants and animals. While the formation of these degradates may be compromised when phosphorous acid is applied as a post-harvest treatment, the recommended application rate will significantly reduce any new dietary exposure or risks and is considered to be safe.\n","EPA-HQ-OPP-2011-1018-0004":"FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) provides that, in considering the establishment of a tolerance or tolerance exemption for a pesticide chemical residue, EPA shall assess the available information about consumption patterns among infants and children, special susceptibility of infants and children to pesticide chemical residues, and the cumulative effects on infants and children of the residues and other substances with a common mechanism of toxicity. In addition, FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C) provides that EPA shall apply an additional tenfold (10X) margin of safety for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for prenatal and postnatal toxicity and the completeness of the database on toxicity and exposure, unless EPA determines that a different margin of safety will be safe for infants and children. This additional margin of safety is commonly referred to as the Food Quality Protection Act Safety Factor. In applying this provision, EPA either retains the default value of 10X, or uses a different additional or no safety factor when reliable data are available to support a different additional or no safety factor. As part of its qualitative assessment, EPA evaluated the available toxicity and exposure data on pear ester and considered its validity, completeness, and reliability, as well as the relationship of this information to human risk. EPA considers the toxicity database to be complete and has identified no residual uncertainty with regard to prenatal and postnatal toxicity or exposure. No hazard was identified based on the available studies. Based upon its evaluation, EPA concludes that there are no threshold effects of concern to infants, children, or adults when pear ester is applied as a mating disruptor of codling moth and used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices.

Many of these rules were added to SIPs and approved by the EPA in the years shortly after the 1970 amendments to the CAA, which for the first time provided for the system of clean air plans that were to be prepared by air agencies and approved by the EPA. At that time, it was widely believed that emission limitations set at levels representing good control of emissions during periods of so-called ``normal'' operation (which, until no later than 1982, was meant by the EPA to refer to periods of operation other than during startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction) could in some cases not be met with the same emission control strategies during periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction.\\2\\ Accordingly, it was common for state plans to include provisions for special, more lenient treatment of excess emissions during such periods of startup, shutdown, maintenance or malfunction. Many of these provisions took the form of absolute or conditional statements that excess emissions from a source, when they occur during startup, shutdown, malfunction or otherwise outside of the source's so- called ``normal'' operations, were not to be considered violations of the air agency rules; i.e., these emissions were considered exempt from legal control.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-127106776,"_task_hash":-454246225,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

Voluntary consensus standards are technical standards (e.g., materials specifications, test methods, sampling procedures, and business practices) that are developed or adopted by voluntary consensus standards bodies. NTTAA directs EPA to provide Congress, through OMB, explanations when the Agency decides not to use available and applicable voluntary consensus standards. This rule will require all sources to meet the applicable monitoring requirements of 40 CFR part 75. Part 75 already incorporates a number of voluntary consensus standards. Consistent with the Agency's Performance Based Measurement System (PBMS), Part 75 sets forth performance criteria that allow the use of alternative methods to the ones set forth in Part 75. The PBMS approach is intended to be more flexible and cost effective for the regulated community; it is also intended to encourage innovation in analytical technology and improved data quality. At this time, EPA is not recommending any revisions to Part 75; however, EPA periodically revises the test procedures set forth in Part 75. When EPA revises the test procedures set forth in Part 75 in the future, EPA will address the use of any new voluntary consensus standards that are equivalent. Currently, even if a test procedure is not set forth in Part 75, EPA is not precluding the use of any method, whether it constitutes a voluntary consensus standard or not, as long as it meets the performance criteria specified; however, any alternative methods must be approved through the petition process under 40 CFR 75.66 before they are used.\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0491-0026":"Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer Advancement Act of 1995 (NTTAA), Public Law 104-113, section 12(d) (15 U.S.C. 272 note) directs EPA to use voluntary consensus standards (VCS) in its regulatory activities unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable law or otherwise impractical.

This disapproval action became effective on January 9, 2012 and started a sanctions clock for imposition of offset sanctions 18 months after January 9, 2012 and highway sanctions 6 months later, pursuant to CAA section 179 and our regulations at 40 CFR 52.31. As such, offset sanctions applied on July 9, 2013 and will continue to apply, and highway sanctions will apply on January 9, 2014, unless EPA determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the disapproval has been corrected.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-625974312,"_task_hash":-362423263,"accept":["no"],"answer":"accept"}

The States comment that they have done their share to reduce in-state emissions, and EPA should ensure each state fully addresses its contribution to any other state's ozone nonattainment. The commenters state that section 110(a)(1) of the CAA requires states like West Virginia to submit, within three years of promulgation of a new NAAQS, an infrastructure SIP which provides for implementation, maintenance, and enforcement of such NAAQS within the state. The commenters remark that West Virginia was required to submit a complete SIP that demonstrated compliance with the good neighbor provision of section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) of the CAA. Maryland also states that EPA must disapprove the infrastructure submittal for element 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) as West Virginia made no submittal for that element. Maryland also argues that if EPA believes EME Homer City prohibits it from disapproving the 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) portion of the West Virginia SIP before the state's significant contribution level is established, then EPA should immediately promulgate such a level. Sierra Club, in turn, states that EPA must disapprove West Virginia's SIP submission for failure to comply with 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). Sierra Club and Maryland both argue that EPA cannot rely on the D.C. Circuit decision in EME Homer City Generation v. EPA, 696 F.3d 7 (D.C. Cir. 2012) as an excuse to ignore obligations established by the Clean Air Act. Sierra Club suggests the relevant language in EME Homer City is dicta and that as this rulemaking action would be appealed to the Fourth Circuit, and EPA is under no obligation to follow that dicta.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-576187248,"_task_hash":1555404890,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

EPA relied upon that comparison to determine that all of the sources in New Mexico are achieving the emission levels assumed by WRAP in its modeling except for the SJGS. SJCC alleged that EPA's summary of that analysis presents no relevant data to support the Agency's conclusion. Because the WRAP inventories are so extensive and difficult to research and review, EPA at a minimum should have provided copies of the State's emissions inventories that were reviewed and the specific emissions data for SJGS that supports EPA's conclusion. SJCC stated that EPA should not have put the burden of interpreting the WRAP technical support documents on the reader. Furthermore, in light of the substantial number and different types of emission sources throughout New Mexico, our conclusion is suspect.

According to the commenter's analysis, Group 1 storage vessels that do not experience an event that would increase emissions would result in an increase from the final NSPS in VOC emissions of over 3 million tpy and methane emissions of over 700,000 tpy. In addition, the commenter states that the six-month delay of the compliance date for Group 2 storage vessels results in an increases of 450,000 tpy of VOC emissions and 100,000 tpy of methane emissions. The commenter added that the removal of a control device from sources whose uncontrolled emissions drop below 4 tpy would result in an emission increase of 3.8 tpy VOC per vessel. Assuming that the 11,600 new vessels the EPA projects would qualify for the uncontrolled actual VOC emission rate, emissions would increase by 23,000 tpy VOC and 5,000 tpy methane. The commenter also contends that the removal of the control device would result in sources left uncontrolled during any unplanned events that would generate significant emissions. Additionally, the commenter states that using their decline curve analysis, new sources would not qualify for uncontrolled actual VOC emission rate for at least 14 years, and the increase in pollution is not justified by the EPA's control device availability concerns.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":2146046742,"_task_hash":1986598215,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Commenters contended that such a methodology produced limits that are not achievable in combination, and as such, the limits do not comport with the intent of the statute or the recent court decision (NRDC v. EPA, 2007). Commenters argue that while the Court's 2007 decision in NRDC v. EPA vacating the first ICI boiler and process heater MACT standard directed EPA to consider individual HAPs, it did not direct EPA to establish a separate floor for each HAP. Commenters further added that the Clean Air Act (CAA) directs EPA to set standards based on the overall performance of ``sources'' and sections 112(d)(1), (2), and (3) specify that emissions standards be established on the ``in practice'' performance of a ``source'' in the category or subcategory. If Congress had intended for EPA to establish MACT floor levels considering the achievable emission limits of individual HAPs, it could have worded 112(d)(3) to refer to the best-performing sources ``for each pollutant.'' Many commenters added that EPA's discretion in setting standards is limited to distinguishing among classes, types, and sizes of sources. However, Congress limited EPA's authority to parse units and sources with similar design and types but it does not allow EPA to ``distinguish'' units and sources by individual pollutant as proposed in this rule [Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 2008)]. By calculating each MACT floor independently of the other pollutants, the combination of HAP limits results in a set of standards that only a hypothetical ``best performing'' unit could achieve.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1315341539,"_task_hash":-980325456,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Until today, EPA has not required any monitoring requirements beyond visual inspections for discharges associated with construction activity, although some NPDES-authorized states (e.g., California, Georgia, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington) have imposed monitoring requirements on construction operators in their permits. See relevant state permit requirements in the rulemaking record (DCNs 42104, 42108-42111).

{"text":"May Title V Permits Be Issued to Exempt Area Sources?","meta":{"# of occurrences: ":"1\n","EPA-HQ-OAR-2004-0010-0114":"In the proposal, we explained and sought comment on our proposed interpretation of the Act as allowing only those area sources required to be permitted under section 502(a), and not exempted by EPA through notice and comment rulemaking to be subject to title V requirements. We are finalizing that interpretation in today's final rule. Thus, after the effective date of today's final rule, permitting authorities, including State and local agencies, tribes, and EPA, may not issue title V permits, including general permits, to area sources we exempt in today's final rule. This interpretation of the Act means that permitting authorities must stop issuing new title V permits to area sources we exempt today, unless they are subject to title V for another reason. Also, this means that any existing title V permits for such exempted area sources must be revoked or terminated after the effective date of today's final rule. However, to avoid disruptions to State programs, States may wait until renewal to end the effectiveness of such permits, unless an area source requests that this be done expeditiously. The EPA believes that State issuance of title V permits to area sources that EPA has exempted from title V permitting requirements would conflict with Congress's intent that EPA define the universe of sources subject to title V, and through inappropriate focus on sources that qualify for an exemption, would be an obstacle to implementation of the title V program. Even if the statute were ambiguous in this regard, EPA would exercise its discretion to interpret it this way to promote effective title V implementation. The proposal included a discussion of these issues, and in the final rule, EPA's interpretation of the Act in this regard is unchanged from the proposal. See section VI below for more on EPA's interpretation of these Act provisions. Note, however, that EPA interprets Section 116 of the Act to allow permitting authorities to issue non-title V permits to area sources that we have exempted from title V permitting.

With the premise that boilers do have variable CO emissions, in order to meet the applicable emission limit, commenters stated that stable boiler operation would be necessary, but that such boiler operation is not always possible. They contend that boiler loads vary constantly and rapidly and such load swings are a normal part of many processes and operations. Factors affecting the load include changes in fuel mix, fuel quantity, and fluctuations in load demand. Quick changes or large swings can also result in spikes which are substantially higher than average emissions.

In the Arkansas RH proposal, EPA did not justify its decision that the presumptive BART limits are unacceptable. EPA is insisting on a five factor analysis even when a source can meet the presumptive limits. EPA's current interpretation of the presumptive BART limits makes the presumptive BART limits meaningless, contrary to the requirements of the CAA and the clear intent of the BART Rule. The CAA singles out electric generating units (EGUs) located at 750 megawatt (MW) power plants for specific BART controls (42 U.S.C. 7491(b)(2)), and EPA adopted the presumptive BART limits to establish the specific control levels required for these EGUs. Since EPA went through extensive analysis to establish presumptive BART limits, the only rational explanation is that EPA intended for those limits to be meaningful. EPA is rationalizing its decision on the Arkansas RH SIP as if the presumptive BART limits were no longer a binding regulation, and there is concern that EPA is attempting to establish new, more stringent presumptive BART limits through case-by-case disapprovals of state BART determinations. Unless and until EPA goes through notice and comment rulemaking to remove the presumptive emission limits and establish other requirements consistent with the CAA, the presumptive BART limits in the promulgated BART Rule continue to establish the requirement that states must meet in their regional haze SIPs for large coal-fired EGUs and EPA must approve a state's BART determination if it meets the presumptive regulatory limits.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-1612438990,"_task_hash":-1278502532,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

The EPA has proposed a total PM limit for existing EGUs of 0.03 lb/MMBtu, as a surrogate limit for non-mercury metal hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) (see 76 FR 24975). EPA should not approve the lax PM limit of 0.1 lb/MMBtu for Flint Creek Boiler No. 1 and Entergy White Bluff Units 1 and 2 as meeting BART for PM because that emission limit is much less stringent than the forthcoming PM MACT requirement. Recent stack testing for White Bluff Units 1 and 2 show that the units will not be able to meet EPA's proposed mercury MACT limit for existing units of 1.2 lb/MMBtu. It is likely that both Flint Creek Boiler No. 1 and White Bluff Units 1 and 2 will need to install baghouses to meet EPA's mercury MACT limit for existing EGUs. It is well known that coal- fired boilers equipped with baghouses achieve better control of mercury than those equipped with ESPs. Activated carbon, a sorbent which adsorbs mercury, is typically much more effective when a baghouse is used compared to an ESP. According to EPA, the form of mercury most easily removed is HgCl2 and the formation of this compound depends on how much chlorine is in the coal--the lower the chlorine content of the coal, the less HgCl2 is formed. EGUs that burn low chlorine coal, such as Flint Creek, often achieve better control of mercury via existing SO2 scrubbers and PM controls.

In particular, the EPA noted four substantive issues that may exist in the previously existing SIPs that the Agency wanted to be clear were not among the issues that states and the EPA are addressing in actions on infrastructure SIPs: (i) Start-up, shut-down, malfunction (SSM) provisions; (ii) director's discretion provisions; (iii) minor source NSR provisions; and (iv) NSR Reform related provisions.\\4\\\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":1580002331,"_task_hash":-46943233,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Referencing the TCEQ's Air Quality Modeling Guidelines and ``Draft Ozone Procedures'' document,\\37\\ the commenters maintain that TCEQ routinely issues PSD permits based on outdated and inadequate ozone modeling procedures. One commenter adds that the ozone screening procedure authorized by the TCEQ's modeling guidance document is partly based on, or equivalent to, inappropriate ``Scheffe Tables.'' Additionally, the commenter states the ozone screening method involves ratios of NOX to VOC without considering the impact of biogenic emissions. Two commenters state that the EPA has on multiple occasions informed the TCEQ that the ozone screening procedures authorized by the TCEQ are outdated and unreliable to evaluate a single source's ozone modeling impact on an air quality control region. One commenter states that the Texas SIP is insufficient to comport with section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act unless it is revised to expressly require case-by-case ozone impact analyses to be conducted for major sources of ozone precursors based on sufficient modeling techniques.

This included reference to various EPA estimates and was supplemented by several estimates for specific areas. Several commenters pointed out the acute need for reduced emissions from these engines in California, particularly in the South Coast Air Basin. For example, over half of current or projected levels of SOx and diesel PM emissions in the South Coast Air Basin are estimated to come from marine vessels (or all port-related sources). SOx emissions from marine vessels in particular would need to be reduced by about 90 percent in the next few years for the South Coast Air Basin to reach timely attainment of the air quality standard for PM2.5. The South Coast Basin is also home to the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which are claimed to be the entry point for 40 percent of the nation's goods, with cargo throughput projected to triple by 2025. Santa Barbara County, California was noted as another particular concern, where 75 percent of local NOX emissions are projected to come from marine vessels, even though there are no commercial ports within county boundaries. One commenter referenced a finding that 70 percent of global shipping emissions occur within 400 kilometers of shore, where pollution transport may range from 400 to 1200 kilometers inland.\n"},"options":[{"id":"yes","text":"\ud83d\ude00 comment response section"},{"id":"no","text":"\ud83d\ude22 not comment response section"},{"id":"unk","text":"\ud83d\ude36 cannot tell if comment response section"}],"_input_hash":-477284591,"_task_hash":-735067280,"accept":["yes"],"answer":"accept"}

Arkansas submitted its RH SIP earlier than most other states, including at least 18 months before North Dakota and Oklahoma, yet EPA did not propose a FIP concurrently with its proposed partial disapproval of the Arkansas RH SIP and it appears it will be several years before the facilities in the State that are contributing to regional haze install pollution controls and reduce emissions. The residents and visitors to the State of Arkansas are getting the short shrift from EPA compared to the residents and visitors of these other states.
